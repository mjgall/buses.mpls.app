# Metro Transit Bus Tracker

Live version: buses.mpls.app

Built originally to display bus arrival times for a predefined set of locations. Subsequently added an authenticated state in which a user can enter and save their own bus stop locations as well as their own Metro Transit Go-To card number that is used to retrieve and display that cardâ€™s current balance. While Metro Transit does provide an API for arrival times by stop ID, Metro Transit does not provide an endpoint for a Go-To card balance or stop location information (such as the intersection of the stop) so instead the information is fetched programmatically by scraping the Metro Transit website.

Run `npm run server` in `./` directory and `npm run start` in `./client` to begin development environment.
